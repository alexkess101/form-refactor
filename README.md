## Here's What I got

### What is it?
- I built an [application](https://github.com/alexkess101/capstone) that tracks door-to-door sales income. It's old and deprecated, but I thought I would refactor the login portion of the app. That is what this repo is all about! 
- I use classes and components to keep track of form state,
scale form data, and handle styling in one place.

### API
- To determine whether or not the credentials are correct I'm using an api I wrote in python a little over a year ago. I'll link the github to that [here](https://github.com/alexkess101/clearSummerAPI). It's sloppy but it works.


### Testing
Clone this repo, `npm start` and go to `localhost:3000`  
I created an account for anyone to test.  
  
`Username:` brandonb@ixn.tech  
`Password:` ixn4life 

There will be an alert message after you hit submit.  
The api is hosted using Heroku's free subscription and can take sometimes 30-45 seconds to load.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
